Iâ€™ve updated my [screen capture tool]({{site.baseUrl}}projects/screen-capture/) to version 2.1.1. It's just a small update: I added the option to always automatically copy the captured image to the clipboard (saves a click if you have to capture a lot of screenshots to paste in a document). I also added an info-dialog which shows the specific version. You can [download it from Box](https://app.box.com/s/4lwepaw898f5ir3bv1dy).
