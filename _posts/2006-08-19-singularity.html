<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> has some new videos about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/">Singularity</a>, an experimental research <abbr>OS</abbr> that is (almost) entirely written in <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/specsharp/">Spec#</a>, a superset of C# (only a very small part of the kernel is written in assembly). The technology they’re researching is just awesome. Here are links to the videos:
