Iâ€™ve updated [my calculator tool]({{site.baseUrl}}projects/calctor/) to version 1.1:

- Optimized the parser
- Changed the meaning of the % operator (now percentage instead of modulo)
- Added synonyms for functions (abbreviations)
- Added some functions: `modulo`, `sign`, `exp`, `secans`, `cosecans`, `arcsinh`, `arccosh`, `arctanh`, `arccotanh`
- Added the option to auto scroll the output region
- The output of an invalid expression now looks less threatening
- Added license information to the Info-window
- Calctor is now prejitted after installation, which should improve performance
