<p>Iâ€™ve updated <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/calctor/">my calculator tool</a> to version 2.1:
<ul>
<li>Fixed some bugs in the snippets
<li>Added a notation to enter numbers with commas as separators between thousands, where the commas are ignored. To do this, just put the number between single quotes. E.g.: <code>'10,000,000'</code>
<li>When the output region has focus, and you start typing, the input region gets focus and receives the keystrokes
<li>Changed the Help-format from <abbr>RTF</abbr> to <abbr>HTML</abbr>
<li>Updated the visual style to use the Office 2007 color schemes. You can chose what color scheme you like (Silver, Black or Blue)
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://app.box.com/s/hd1fulwrkasfnm2qxeev">download it from Box</a>.
