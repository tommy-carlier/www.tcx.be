I’ve updated [my calculator tool]({{site.baseUrl}}projects/calctor/) to version 2.0:

- Fixed some bugs in the snippets
- Refactored the code, so I could extract the calculation engine into a separate library
- Updated the visual style and the icons
- Added a new option: *Don’t ask to save changes*
- Changed the parser: the leading zero is now optional (you can enter `.75` instead of `0.75`)

You can [download it from Box](https://app.box.com/s/hd1fulwrkasfnm2qxeev).
