title: "Synchronizing Google Calendar and Contacts with iOS 6"
---

<p>I still use a 4th generation iPod Touch. Although I’m stuck with iOS 6, it still works fine for doing the things I use it for:
e-mail, contacts, calendar, alarm clock, reading RSS-feeds (Reeder, reading from Feedly), Twitter, and Pocket.</p>

<p>For e-mail, I use the GMail application. For contacts and calendar, I use Apple’s native Contacts and Calendars apps,
synchronized with my Google account via the Exchange protocol. Until recently, this worked fine. I had offline access to
my contacts and calendar events, and it synchronized when I was online.

<p>About a month ago, synchronization stopped working. I don’t get any error message, it just doesn’t synchronize anymore.
Today, I solved the problem by removing the Exchange account, and performing the following steps.</p>

<h2>Synchronized calendars: add a Google account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings › Mail, Contacts, Calendar › Add Account › GMail”</li>
<li>Enter the following information:<dl>
  <dt>Name<dd>your full name
  <dt>Email<dd>your e-mail address
  <dt>Password<dd>your Google account password
  <dt>Description<dd>a description of the account
</dl></li>
<li>Select which services you want to synchronize: E-mail, Calendars, Notes (I only synchronize calendars)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Synchronized contacts: add a {% include wikipedia-link.html term="CardDAV" %} account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings › Mail, Contacts, Calendar › Add Account › Other › Add CardDAV Account”</li>
<li>Enter the following information:<dl>
  <dt>Server<dd>google.com
  <dt>User Name<dd>your e-mail address
  <dt>Password<dd>your Google account password
  <dt>Description<dd>a description of the account
</dl></li>
</ol>
