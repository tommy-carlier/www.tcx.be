title: "Synchronize Google Calendar & Contacts with iOS 6"
---

<p>I still use a 4th generation iPod Touch. Although I’m stuck with iOS 6, it still works fine for doing the things I use it for:
e-mail, contacts, calendar, alarm clock, reading RSS-feeds (<a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a>,
reading from <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>), Twitter (using <a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>),
and <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>.</p>

<p>For e-mail, I use the GMail application. For contacts and calendar, I use Apple’s native Contacts and Calendars apps,
synchronized with my Google account via the Exchange protocol. Until recently, this worked fine. I had offline access to
my contacts and calendar events, and it synchronized when I was online.

<p>About a month ago, synchronization stopped working. I don’t get any error message, it just doesn’t synchronize anymore.
Today, I solved the problem by removing the Exchange account, and performing the following steps.</p>

<h2>Synchronized calendars: add a Google account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings › Mail, Contacts, Calendar › Add Account › GMail”</li>
<li>Enter the following information:<table>
  <tr><th>Name<td>your full name</tr>
  <tr><th>Email<td>your e-mail address</tr>
  <tr><th>Password<td>your Google account password</tr>
  <tr><th>Description<td>a description of the account</tr>
</table></li>
<li>Select which services you want to synchronize: E-mail, Calendars, Notes (I only synchronize calendars)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Synchronized contacts: add a {% include wikipedia-link.html term="CardDAV" %} account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings › Mail, Contacts, Calendar › Add Account › Other › Add CardDAV Account”</li>
<li>Enter the following information:<table>
  <tr><th>Server<td>google.com</tr>
  <tr><th>User Name<td>your e-mail address</tr>
  <tr><th>Password<td>your Google account password</tr>
  <tr><th>Description<td>a description of the account</tr>
</table></li>
</ol>
