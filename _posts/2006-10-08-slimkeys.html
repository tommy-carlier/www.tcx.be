title: "slimKEYS"
---

<p>On <a href="{% post_url 2006-10-07-free-tools %}">my previous post about free tools I use</a>, I got a comment from Martin Plante, who used to work for <a href="http://xceed.com/">Xceed</a>, but has started a new company called <a href="http://slimcode.com/">slimCODE</a>. He told me about this tool he created called <a href="http://slimcode.com/slimKEYS/">slimKEYS</a>, which is a universal hotkey manager, that has a plugin that allows you to quickly launch applications and documents.

<p>So I installed it, modified some of the hotkeys (I like <kbd>Win+Esc</kbd> for launching apps), and tried out some different stuff. And I must say, I like it a lot more than the already great launcher <a href="http://colibri.leetspeak.org/">Colibri</a>. One thing I like about slimKEYS is that it looks and feels like a Windows application. Colibri looks very different, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think slimKEYS integrates better with my environment.

<p>Because it has a plugin system, I think slimKEYS has a bright future. It’s probably easier for Martin to extend slimKEYS himself with new functionality, but it also allows for external developers to develop cool plugins. This opportunity creates a developer community that will help push slimKEYS forward.

<p>The most used plugin for me will be <i>slimLAUNCH</i>, for launching applications and documents. You can fully customize what folders slimLAUNCH should watch, and (like any plugin) what hotkey to use. I changed the default <kbd>Win+Z</kbd> to <kbd>Win+Esc</kbd>. One thing slimLAUNCH doesn’t do yet that Colibri does, is the ability to quickly launch items from the Control Panel, like <i>“Add or remove programs”</i>.

<p>The other plugins that are included right now are: <i>slimLAUNCHthis</i>, for launching a specific application or document by pressing a hotkey; <i>slimSIZE</i>, for moving and/or resizing the active window to a specific location and size; and <i>slimVOLUME</i>, for modifying the volume level.

<p>The following plugins are planned: <i>slimSEARCH</i>, for quickly searching on your favorite search engines; <i>slimMESSAGE</i>, for sending windows messages to any window; <i>slimSCRIPT</i>, for executing your own C# or VB.NET code on demand; and <i>slimPASTE</i>, for pasting the content of the clipboard, after stripping formatting or variants.
