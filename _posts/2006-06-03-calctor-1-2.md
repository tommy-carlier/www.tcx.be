I’ve updated my calculator tool to version 1.2:

- Fixed some bugs, and added some optimizations
- Added some buttons to the header of the input-region
- Added ² and ³ as synonyms for ^2 and ^3
- Added some functions: `gcd`, `lcm`, `addTimes`, `round(x, n)`
- Added a new menu to insert snippets
- Added the function *New from template*, and a directory with some templates
- Comments on a separate line are now also displayed in the output
- Embedded URLs are converted to hyperlinks in the output
