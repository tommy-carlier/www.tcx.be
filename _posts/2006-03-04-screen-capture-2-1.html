<p>Iâ€™ve updated my <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/screen-capture/">screen capture tool</a> to version 2.1. You now have the option to <i>Minimize to System Tray</i>. You can then right-click the system tray icon to access most functionality. You can <a href="https://app.box.com/s/4lwepaw898f5ir3bv1dy">download it from Box</a>.
