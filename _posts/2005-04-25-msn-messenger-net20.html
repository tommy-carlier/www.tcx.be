title: "MSN Messenger + .NET 2.0"
---

<p>I just had this crazy idea: what if the next version of <nobr><abbr>MSN</abbr> Messenger</nobr> would be written in .NET 2.0? Wouldn’t it be cool if <nobr><abbr>MSN</abbr> Messenger</nobr> had:
<ul>
<li>ClickOnce deployment
<li>Automatic updating, not visible to the user
<li>Plugins with extra functionality that is only downloaded when necessary (games, …)
</ul>

<p>I think it would definitely make .NET 2.0 very popular. And it would create a whole new market: <nobr><abbr>MSN</abbr> Messenger</nobr> plugins (games and other applications that use the <nobr><abbr>MSN</abbr> Messenger</nobr> <i>platform</i>).
