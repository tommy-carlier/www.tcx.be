<p>I like drawing. I’ve always liked drawing, usually silly pictures, caricatures, funny stuff. In the past, I’ve tried several different graphical applications. I tried <a href="http://www.adobe.com/nl/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>, but I never really liked it. I tried <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, don’t like it. For a long time, <a href="http://www.paintshoppro.com/">Paint Shop Pro</a> was the application I liked best (together with MS Paint, for pixel painting). But last year, I discovered <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>: an open-source .NET application, developed in C#, that has the familiar UI and speed of MS Paint, and a lot of the more advanced features of large apps like Photoshop or PSP. If you haven’t used it before, please try it out. It’s awesome.
