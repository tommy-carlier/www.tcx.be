Iâ€™ve updated my [screen capture tool]({{site.baseUrl}}projects/screen-capture/) to version 2.1. You now have the option to *Minimize to System Tray*. You can then right-click the system tray icon to access most functionality. You can [download it from Box](https://app.box.com/s/4lwepaw898f5ir3bv1dy).
