Iâ€™ve updated [my calculator tool]({{site.baseUrl}}projects/calctor/) to version 2.1:

- Fixed some bugs in the snippets
- Added a notation to enter numbers with commas as separators between thousands, where the comma's are ignored. To do this, just put the number between single quotes. E.g.: `'10,000,000'`
- When the output region has focus, and you start typing, the input region gets focus and receives the keystrokes
- Changed the Help-format from RTF to HTML
- Updated the visual style to use the Office 2007 color schemes. You can chose what color scheme you like (Silver, Black or Blue)
