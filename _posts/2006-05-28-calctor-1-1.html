<p>Iâ€™ve updated <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/calctor/">my calculator tool</a> to version 1.1:
<ul>
<li>Optimized the parser
<li>Changed the meaning of the % operator (now percentage instead of modulo)
<li>Added synonyms for functions (abbreviations)
<li>Added some functions: <var>modulo</varvar>, <var>sign</var>, <var>exp</var>, <var>secans</var>, <var>cosecans</var>, <var>arcsinh</var>, <var>arccosh</var>, <var>arctanh</var>, <var>arccotanh</var>
<li>Added the option to auto scroll the output region
<li>The output of an invalid expression now looks less threatening
<li>Added license information to the Info-window
<li>Calctor is now prejitted after installation, which should improve performance
</ul>
