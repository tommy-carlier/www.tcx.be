<p>I’ve been trying out <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> for about a week now. I’m still a bit skeptical about it, but I can see at least 1 advantage: there’s a very close contact between followers and followees. It’s a lot easier to write a quick tweet to someone than it is to comment on their blog. There’s a very convenient bi-directional communication. The 140 character limit is something to get used to, but it also makes you think about what you write. I do like the conventions of replying to someone or mentioning someone via <kbd>@</kbd>, or referencing an event via <kbd>#</kbd>.
