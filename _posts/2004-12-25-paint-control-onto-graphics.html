title: "Painting a Control onto a Graphics‑object"
---

<p><i>Edit 2005-10-29: as of .NET 2.0, the <var>Control</var> class has a method to draw itself to a Bitmap: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms158401.aspx"><var>DrawToBitmap</var></a>, which you should use instead.</i>

<p>Here’s a little class in C#, that allows you to paint an existing Control onto a Graphics object. Nothing special, but useful if you need it.
{% include code-snippet.html file="ControlPainter.cs" %}

<p>Using it is very easy: if you need to paint the Control <var>myControl</var> onto Graphics <var>myGraphics</var>, you just call <code>ControlPainter.PaintControl(myGraphics, myControl);</code>
