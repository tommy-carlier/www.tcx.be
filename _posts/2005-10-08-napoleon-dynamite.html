title: "Napoleon Dynamite"
---

<p>I just watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/">Napoleon Dynamite</a> for the 5th time in less than 2 weeks. The first time I watched it, I was a bit confused. I liked it, but I didn’t know why. The movie has a slow pace, and the jokes are not obvious. Then I watched it again. And I realized that I like it because, although the movie takes place in 2004, it takes me back to the 80’s, to my youth. It's about the small things in life. The main characters are people we all recognize, average people, <i>anti-heroes</i>.

<p>This movie is a beautiful, feel-good movie that doesn't need sex, violence or prophanities to appeal to people. If you have a confused feeling after watching it once, please watch it again: you might get it, you might pick up subtle things that weren’t obvious the first time.
