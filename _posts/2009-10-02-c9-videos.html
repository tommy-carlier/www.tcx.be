title: "Awesome videos on Channel 9 this week"
---

<p>Channel 9 has always produced nice videos with interviews, or weekly shows (This Week on Channel 9, Ping), but this week they have exceeded themselves in quality and awesomeness. I especially liked the following videos:

<ul>
<li>Reactive Framework (Rx) Under the Hood: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/E2E-Erik-Meijer-and-Wes-Dyer-Reactive-Framework-Rx-Under-the-Hood-1-of-2/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/E2E-Erik-Meijer-and-Wes-Dyer-Reactive-Framework-Rx-Under-the-Hood-2-of-2/">part 2</a>
<li>The Visual Studio Documentary: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/series/visualstudiodocumentary/the-visual-studio-documentary-part-one">part 1</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/series/visualstudiodocumentary/the-visual-studio-documentary-part-two">part 2</a>
<li>C9 Lectures: Dr. Erik Meijer – Functional Programming Fundamentals, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/Lecture-Series-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-1">Chapter 1 of 13</a>
</ul>

<p>Besides being a fan of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/">This Week on Channel 9</a> and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/PingShow/">Ping</a>, I also loved the series “<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/series/history">The History of Microsoft</a>” (25 episodes) a while ago. I think Channel 9 is still revolutionary (related to the videos), despite the buggy forum.
