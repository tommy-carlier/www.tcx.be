title: "Once upon a time in America"
---

<p>On <a href="{% post_url 2006-06-27-the-world-is-yours %}">my previous post about the movie “Scarface”</a>, I got a comment from <a href="http://blogs.u2u.be/peter/">Peter Himschoot</a>, who said I would also like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087843/">“Once upon a time in America”</a>. So last week I bought the <abbr>DVD</abbr> on eBay, and this morning I got up early to watch it. It’s a long movie (almost 4 hours), but it never feels long. It’s a story that needs a long time to tell properly. It features a great cast (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/">Robert De Niro</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000249/">James Woods</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001235/">William Forsythe</a>, …) and some of the most beautiful music I ever heard in a movie (from the hand of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001553/">Ennio Morricone</a>). Truely a masterpiece.
