<p>I just finished watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/">Scarface</a>, and Iâ€™m very impressed. I always thought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/">Al Pacino</a> was a great actor, but I had never seen any of his earlier work. This just adds a whole new perspective. The movie is strong and violent. It shows the other side of the <i>American dream</i>, it shows what power and greed can do to a guy.
