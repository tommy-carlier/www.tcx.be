title: "Writing a parser: introduction to ADL"
---

This post will introduce ADL (*Acronymic Demonstrational Language*), a language I designed to demonstrate how to write a parser.

## Statements

ADL has 5 different types of statements:

- if-statement
- while-loop
- for-loop
- assignment
- function call

An if-statement looks like this:

```
if expression then
    statements
end if
```

An if-statement can also have an else-clause:

```
if expression then
    statements
else
    statements
end if
```

A while-loop looks like this:

```
while expression do
    statements
end while
```

A for-loop looks like this:

```
for variable := expression to expression do
    statements
end for
```

A for-loop can also have a by-clause that defines the number to add to the variable on each iteration:

```
for variable := expression to expression by expression do
    statements
end for
```

An assignment looks like this:

```
variable := expression
```

A function call looks like this:

```
function()
```

It can also have one or more arguments separated by commas:

```
function(expression, expression, expression)
```

## Expressions

Expressions in ADL consist of variables, constants, function calls, unary expressions, binary expressions and groups.

Variable names start with a letter, followed by zero or more letters or numbers.

ADL has 2 types of constants: strings and integer numbers. A string is a sequence of characters, enclosed between 2 quotes. An integer is a sequence of 1 or more digits.

Unary expressions are expressions with an operator that has only 1 operand:

- positive operator: <b>+</b> *expression*
- negative operator: <b>-</b> *expression*
- logical NOT-operator: **not** *expression*

Binary expressions are expressions with an operator that has 2 operands:

- logical AND-operator: *expression* **and** *expression*
- logical OR-operator: *expression* **or** *expression*
- comparison: *expression comparator expression* (*comparator* is one of the following: <b>==</b>, <b>&lt;&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;=</b>)
- addition: *expression* <b>+</b> *expression*
- subtraction: *expression* <b>-</b> *expression*
- multiplication: *expression* <b>*</b> *expression*
- division: *expression* <b>/</b> *expression*

A group is an expression between parentheses: <b>(</b> *expression* <b>)</b>

## Precedence

When an expression is built from multiple operators, the expression is evaluated in the following order:

- Grouping: `( )`
- Unary expression: `+ - not`
- Multiplicative expression: `* /`
- Additive expression: `+ -`
- Comparison: `== <> < > <= >=`
- Logical OR: `or`
- Logical AND: `and`
