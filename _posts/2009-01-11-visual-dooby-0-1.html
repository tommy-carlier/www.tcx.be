title: "Visual Dooby 0.1"
---

<p>I just uploaded an initial version of <i>Visual Dooby</i>, a portable lightweight database client.

<p>This initial release is quite limited. You can currently only connect to a SQL Server database, the database browser only displays tables, views and columns, and you can save the results of a query to an XML-file.

<p>Some nice features are the advanced customizations when saving to XML, the visualization of data types in the result grid and the grid row numbering.

<p>You can <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/1ief43febt">download it from Box</a>.
