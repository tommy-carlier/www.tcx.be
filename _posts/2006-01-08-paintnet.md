title: "Paint.NET"

I like drawing. I’ve always liked drawing, usually silly pictures, caricatures, funny stuff. In the past, I’ve tried several different graphical applications. I tried [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/nl/products/photoshop.html), but I never really liked it. I tried [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), don’t like it. For a long time, [Paint Shop Pro](http://www.paintshoppro.com/) was the application I liked best (together with MS Paint, for pixel painting). But last year, I discovered [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/): an open-source .NET application, developed in C#, that has the familiar UI and speed of MS Paint, and a lot of the more advanced features of large apps like Photoshop or PSP. If you haven’t used it before, please try it out. It’s awesome.
