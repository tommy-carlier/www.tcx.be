title: "Rounding a floating point value to a certain precision"
hasCSharpCode: true

<p>For my work, I needed to round a floating point value (<var>double</var> in C#) to a precision of 0.05. Unfortunately, <var>Math.Round</var> only lets you round a value to the nearest decimal. That means you can only round to 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, … To round your values to 0.05, or 0.25, or whatever, I created the following function:
