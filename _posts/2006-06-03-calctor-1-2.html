<p>I’ve updated <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/calctor/">my calculator tool</a> to version 1.2:
<ul>
<li>Fixed some bugs, and added some optimizations
<li>Added some buttons to the header of the input-region
<li>Added ² and ³ as synonyms for <code>^2</code> and <code>^3</code>
<li>Added some functions: <var>gcd</var>, <var>lcm</var>, <var>addTimes</var>, <var>round(x, n)</var>
<li>Added a new menu to insert snippets
<li>Added the function <i>New from template</i>, and a directory with some templates
<li>Comments on a separate line are now also displayed in the output
<li>Embedded <nobr><abbr>URL</abbr>s</nobr> are converted to hyperlinks in the output
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://app.box.com/s/hd1fulwrkasfnm2qxeev">download it from Box</a>.
