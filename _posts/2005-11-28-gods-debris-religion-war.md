title: God’s Debris & The Religion War
---

This weekend, I read [Scott Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams)’ “God’s Debris” and “The Religion War”. Although the second is the sequel to the first, they are both quite different.

[“God’s Debris”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Debris) is what Scott Adams himself calls a thought experiment wrapped in a story. I experienced it as a fascinating trip that makes you think more deeply about certain aspects of life, the universe and religion. It’s fiction, it has absolutely no scientific background, but the ideas in it just sound right to me.

[“The Religion War”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Religion_War) is the sequel, but is totally different. It has an actual plot, and it reads more like a traditional novel. The story takes place in the near future and talks about what happens with main character of “God’s Debris”. You can’t download it for free, but you can buy it at Amazon.
