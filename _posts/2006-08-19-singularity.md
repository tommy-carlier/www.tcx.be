[Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) has 2 new videos about Singularity, an experimental research OS that is (almost) entirely written in Spec#, a superset of C# (only a very small part of the kernel is written in assembly). The technology they’re researching is just awesome. Here are some links:
