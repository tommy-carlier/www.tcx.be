<p>Iâ€™ve updated my <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/screen-capture/">screen capture tool</a> to version 2.1.1. It's just a small update: I added the option to always automatically copy the captured image to the clipboard (saves a click if you have to capture a lot of screenshots to paste in a document). I also added an info-dialog which shows the specific version.

<p>You can <a href="https://app.box.com/s/4lwepaw898f5ir3bv1dy">download it from Box</a>.
