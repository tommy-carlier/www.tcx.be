title: "Once upon a time in America"
---

On [my previous post about the movie “Scarface”]({% post_url 2006-06-27-the-world-is-yours %}), I got a comment from [Peter Himschoot](http://blogs.u2u.be/peter/), who said I would also like [“Once upon a time in America”](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087843/). So last week I bought the DVD on eBay, and this morning I got up early to watch it. It’s a long movie (almost 4 hours), but it never feels long. It’s a story that needs a long time to tell properly. It features a great cast ([Robert De Niro](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/), [James Woods](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000249/), [William Forsythe](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001235/), …) and some of the most beautiful music I ever heard in a movie (from the hand of [Ennio Morricone](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001553/)). Truely a masterpiece.
