<p>Iâ€™ve updated my <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/screen-capture/">screen capture tool</a> to version 2.2. I fixed a few bugs, and added these features:
<ul>
<li>The size of the captured image is displayed in the statusbar.
<li>The captured image is stretched when resizing the window.
<li>A new function is added to capture the content of a selected window.
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://app.box.com/s/4lwepaw898f5ir3bv1dy">download it from Box</a>.
