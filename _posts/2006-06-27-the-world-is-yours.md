I just finished watching [Scarface](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/), and Iâ€™m very impressed. I always thought [Al Pacino](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/) was a great actor, but I had never seen any of his earlier work. This just adds a whole new perspective. The movie is strong and violent. It shows the other side of the *American dream*, it shows what power and greed can do to a guy.
