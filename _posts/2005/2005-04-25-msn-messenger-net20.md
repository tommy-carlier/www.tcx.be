title: MSN Messenger + .NET 2.0
---

I just had this crazy idea: what if the next version of MSN Messenger would be written in .NET 2.0? Wouldn't it be cool if MSN Messenger had:

- ClickOnce deployment
- Automatic updating, not visible to the user
- Plugins with extra functionality that is only downloaded when necessary (games, â€¦)

I think it would definitely make .NET 2.0 very popular. And it would create a whole new market: MSN Messenger plugins (games and other applications that use the MSN Messenger *platform*).
