<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx"><var>IDisposable</var></a> is a pattern in .NET that is used to implement deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources. .NET has a garbage collector, but that is only used to manage memory, not resources like I/O (file handles, sockets, …). While in C++ destructors are called deterministically when an object goes out of scope, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0s71x931.aspx">finalizers</a> in C# get called by the garbage collector, but we can’t determine when that will happen (indeterministic deallocation). <i>Don’t depend on the garbage collector for unmanaged resources!</i>

<h2>Properly disposing resources</h2>
<p>The <var>IDisposable</var>-interface has a single method <code>void <b>Dispose</b>()</code>. This method is used to clean up the disposable object and release the unmanaged resources it holds. To make sure that you always call it, even if an exception occurs in the code between creating the object and calling its <var>Dispose</var>-method, you should use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zwc8s4fz.aspx"><var>try-finally</var></a>-construct, like this: {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/TryFinallyDispose.cs" %}

<p>Because this pattern is so common, C# has the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh598w02.aspx"><var>using</var></a>-construct that does this more succinctly: {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/Using.cs" %}

<p>The advantage of this construct is that you can easily nest it without writing a lot of code: {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/UsingNested.cs" %}

<p>Or with less indentation and curly braces: {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/UsingNestedCleaner.cs" %}

<p>This is (more or less) equivalent to the following code: {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/TryFinallyDisposeNested.cs" %}

<h2>Properly implementing <var>IDisposable</var> in your own classes</h2>
<p>Here’s the minimal proper implementation of <var>IDisposable</var> for a regular class that can be inherited (i.e. is not <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/88c54tsw.aspx">sealed</a>): {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/MyDisposableType.cs" %}

<p>In the classes that derive from such a disposable class, you don’t have to implement the entire pattern again: you can just override the <code>Dispose(bool disposing)</code>-method to add extra clean-up code. Just make sure you call the base-method (after the added code, in a <var>finally</var>-block): {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/MyDerivedDisposableType.cs" %}

<p>If your class is sealed (so there can be no derived classes), you cannot have virtual methods. To properly implement the <var>IDisposable</var>-pattern, you could make the <code>Dispose(bool disposing)</code>-method private and not virtual: {% include code-snippet-csharp.html file="idisposable/MySealedDisposableType.cs" %}
