<p>I just uploaded a new version of <i>for-i-repeat</i>. The only major changes are:
<ul>
<li>The location and size of the window are now remembered (stored in a settings-file)
<li>The visual style has been improved (uses more recent version of the <a href="http://tc.codeplex.com/">TC Libraries</a>)
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/afyf5kkpsy">download it from Box</a>.
