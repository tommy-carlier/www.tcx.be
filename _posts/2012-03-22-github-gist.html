<p>I decided to create a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>-account, specifically to manage the code snippets I occasionally publish on this blog via <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>. Now you get nice syntax-coloring, and itâ€™s easier for me to manage and update the snippets.

<p>My GitHub account-name is <a href="https://github.com/tommy-carlier"><var>tommy-carlier</var></a>, and you can find my code snippets <a href="https://gist.github.com/tommy-carlier">here</a>.
