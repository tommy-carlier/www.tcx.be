title: "Writing a parser: Base VS2005 solution"
---

Iâ€™ve created an (almost) empty VS2005 solution that will be the base solution to build our parser from. It contains 2 projects: *TC.Adl* (the ADL Class Library that will contain the parser) and *TC.Adl.Test* (the WinForms application for testing the library).

The test application has a main form (`FormMain`) that displays a list of test cases to run. This list is automatically filled with all the classes in `TC.Adl.Test` that derive from [System.Windows.Forms.Form](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.aspx). That way, we can add test cases without having to modify `FormMain` each time.

You can [download it from Box](https://app.box.com/s/9kidi2a2knibx1zs9ek2).
